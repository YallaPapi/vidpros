## Performance Metrics

### Speed
- Research: 5-10 seconds per prospect
- Script Generation: 3-5 seconds
- Video Creation: 30-45 seconds
- Report Generation: 10-15 seconds
- **Total Pipeline**: 48-75 seconds per prospect

### Cost
- Research: $0.05 (API calls)
- Script: $0.02 (GPT-4)
- Video: $0.10-0.15 (D-ID/HeyGen)
- Report: $0.30-0.45 (Multi-agent GPT-4)
- Distribution: $0.05
- **Total**: $0.52-0.72 per prospect ✅
