## Video Script Templates

### The "Friendly Neighbor" Approach:
"Hi [Name], I was researching HVAC companies in [City] and noticed you're still taking calls for scheduling. I get it - that personal touch matters. But here's the thing... [Competitor] started booking 40% more jobs just by adding online scheduling. Takes 10 minutes to set up. Worth a quick coffee to discuss?"

### The "Competitor Alert" Approach:
"Hey [Name], noticed [Competitor] just launched online booking. They're probably capturing your after-hours leads now. Want to level the playing field? I can show you how in 15 minutes..."
