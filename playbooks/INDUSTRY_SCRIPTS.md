## HVAC Companies

### Script 1: The After-Hours Opportunity
```
Hi [Owner Name],

I was looking at [Company Name]'s website at 9 PM last night - you know, 
when homeowners' AC breaks and they're desperately searching for help.

Your phone number was there, but no way to book service online.

Meanwhile, [Competitor] lets customers book instantly 24/7.

Industry data shows HVAC companies miss $10,000 monthly in after-hours bookings.

Takes 15 minutes to fix this. Want me to show you how [Similar Company] 
added $120K in revenue just from online scheduling?

Worth a quick call?
```

### Script 2: The Technician Shortage Angle
```
[Owner Name], quick question...

How many calls did your dispatcher handle yesterday while also trying to 
route technicians and deal with angry customers?

I noticed [Company] still schedules everything by phone.

What if I told you AccuTemp HVAC eliminated their dispatcher position 
entirely and customers actually prefer it?

Automated scheduling, routing, and updates. Customers love the control, 
techs love the efficiency.

15 minutes to see if this could free up your team?
```

### Script 3: The Summer Rush Pain
```
Hey [Name],

July's coming... remember last year's chaos? 
100-degree days, phones ringing off the hook, scheduling nightmares?

I checked - you're still using the same manual system.

CoolBreeze HVAC used to lose $5K daily from double-bookings and missed calls 
during peak season. Now? Automated everything.

Their best July ever - 40% more jobs, zero overtime for office staff.

Want their exact playbook?

streamlining insurance handling.

15 minutes to show you their system?

### Script 3: The Estimate Bottleneck
```
[Owner Name], be honest...

How long between site visit and sending the estimate?
2 days? 3? A week?

Your competitors using instant estimate software close same-day.

I found 5 roofing companies in [City] already using automated estimates.
They're eating your lunch.

Want to fight back? I'll show you exactly what they're using.
