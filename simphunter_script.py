Hi {prospect_name}, I've been following SimPHunter and The Federation network closely, 
and I noticed something interesting. You've built an incredible community of {audit_results['network_size']:,} 
agency owners, but they're all struggling with the same operational bottlenecks - manually 
vetting models, tracking payments, and managing content across multiple accounts. What if 
you could offer them the automation tools they desperately need?
""",
    
    'CREDIBILITY (20 seconds)': f"""
I'm Alex from VideoReach. We specialize in automation for unconventional industries that 
traditional software ignores. We've helped adult content platforms scale from managing 
50 creators to 5000, and payment processors automate their compliance workflows. I understand 
the unique challenges of the OnlyFans ecosystem - the constant platform changes, payment 
processing hurdles, and the need for discretion.
""",
    
    'PROBLEM DEEP DIVE (60 seconds)': f"""
Looking at The Federation network, I see {audit_results['network_size']:,} agency owners each 
wasting {audit_results['manual_hours_per_week'] // audit_results['network_size']} hours per week on 
repetitive tasks. They're manually onboarding models, which involves identity verification, 
contract management, and account setup - taking 2-3 hours per model. 

They're juggling content across multiple platforms - OnlyFans, Fansly, Twitter, Instagram, 
TikTok - with no centralized scheduling. Revenue tracking is a nightmare - calculating splits, 
tracking tips, managing chargebacks, all in spreadsheets that break at scale.

Most critically, there's no collaboration platform for The Federation itself. Members are 
sharing intel through scattered Telegram messages instead of a structured knowledge base. 
The real opportunity here isn't just saving time - it's becoming the infrastructure provider 
for the entire OnlyFans agency industry.
""",
    
    'OPPORTUNITY 1 (45 seconds)': f"""
Let's start with the biggest pain point: model onboarding and management. We can build 
an automated platform that handles the entire model lifecycle - from initial application 
through identity verification, contract signing, account creation, and ongoing management. 

Here's how it works: Models apply through a branded portal, AI verifies their identity 
and age, smart contracts handle revenue splits automatically, and agencies get a complete 
CRM view of their roster. One agency using similar automation now onboards 50 models per 
month with zero manual work. For The Federation network, this could save 
{audit_results['total_models_in_network'] * 2} hours monthly across all agencies.
""",
    
    'OPPORTUNITY 2 (45 seconds)': f"""
Second opportunity: centralized content management and scheduling. Imagine a platform where 
agencies can manage content for all their models across every platform from one dashboard. 
Upload once, publish everywhere, with AI optimizing posting times for maximum engagement.

The system would handle watermarking, comply with each platform's rules, track performance 
metrics, and even suggest content strategies based on what's working. Agencies report that 
centralized scheduling alone increases revenue by 30% through consistent posting. With 
{audit_results['total_models_in_network']:,} potential models in your network, that's 
${audit_results['total_models_in_network'] * audit_results['revenue_per_model'] * 0.3:,.0f} 
in additional monthly revenue.
""",
    
    'OPPORTUNITY 3 (45 seconds)': f"""
The third opportunity is turning The Federation into a true platform. Right now, you have 
{audit_results['network_size']:,} members sharing knowledge through Telegram. We can build 
a private platform with structured knowledge sharing, verified vendor marketplace, automated 
model trading between agencies, and performance benchmarking.

Think of it as the Bloomberg Terminal for OnlyFans agencies. Members could see industry 
benchmarks, trade models between agencies with automated contract transfers, and access 
verified service providers. You could charge $99-299/month for platform access, generating 
${audit_results['network_size'] * 149:,.0f} in monthly recurring revenue.
""",
    
    'ROI BREAKDOWN (40 seconds)': f"""
Let's talk numbers. For SimPHunter as a platform provider: Licensing the automation suite 
to just 20% of your {audit_results['network_size']:,} members at $497/month generates 
${audit_results['network_size'] * 0.2 * 497:,.0f} monthly. The Federation platform at 
$149/month for 50% adoption adds ${audit_results['network_size'] * 0.5 * 149:,.0f}. 

Total monthly recurring revenue: ${(audit_results['network_size'] * 0.2 * 497) + (audit_results['network_size'] * 0.5 * 149):,.0f}. 
That's ${((audit_results['network_size'] * 0.2 * 497) + (audit_results['network_size'] * 0.5 * 149)) * 12:,.0f} annually. 

Development investment is approximately ${audit_results['implementation_cost']:,}, giving you 
a {(((audit_results['network_size'] * 0.2 * 497) + (audit_results['network_size'] * 0.5 * 149)) * 12) / audit_results['implementation_cost']:.1f}x ROI 
in year one. Plus, you become the essential infrastructure for the entire industry.
""",
    
    'IMPLEMENTATION (30 seconds)': f"""
Here's the rollout plan. Month 1: We build the model onboarding system and test with 
5 friendly agencies. Month 2: Add content scheduling and launch to 50 beta users. 
Month 3: Federation platform goes live with knowledge base and benchmarking. Month 4: 
Full launch to all {audit_results['network_size']:,} members.

You maintain complete control and ownership. This isn't just software - it's building 
a moat around your business that competitors can't cross. Every agency that adopts your 
tools becomes locked into your ecosystem.
""",
    
    'URGENCY (20 seconds)': f"""
{prospect_name}, timing is critical. The OnlyFans industry is maturing rapidly, and 
whoever provides the infrastructure will dominate. {company_data['competitors'][0]} is 
already building internal tools, but they're keeping them proprietary. You have the 
community trust and reach to become the industry standard. Every month you wait, agencies 
are building their own half-baked solutions or worse - leaving the industry due to 
operational overwhelm.
""",
    
    'CTA (20 seconds)': f"""
{prospect_name}, I've mapped out the complete platform architecture for SimPHunter - 
the automation suite, The Federation platform, even how to white-label it for enterprise 
agencies. This could transform SimPHunter from an education platform into the operating
